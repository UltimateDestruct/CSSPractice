- Inverse tables are only working correctly in Bootstrap version 4 alpha, which breaks compatibility with other things I'm doing. The inverse tables should have CSS classes loaded that I define.
- The lables for the radiobuttons are currently ugly colored boxes that I quickly implimented because I was having trouble with radiobuttons and CSS. The colored boxes should be removed and a similar CSS class should be created in a drop down.
