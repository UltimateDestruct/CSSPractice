- Inverse tables are only working correctly in Bootstrap version 4 alpha, which breaks compatibility with other things I'm doing. The inverse tables should have CSS classes loaded that I define.
- The lables for the radiobuttons are currently ugly colored boxes that I quickly implimented because I was having trouble with radiobuttons and CSS. The colored boxes should be removed and a similar CSS class should be created in a drop down.
- Warning/Success/Error text boxes are currently not working at all.
- The rest of the text box drop downs need to have CSS applied to them.
