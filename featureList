- Change index.html to use bootstrap grids instead of 50% width divs.

- Refactor the javascript to have a smaller, better designed function. Right now there is a lot of copy/pasting that could be solved by a better function.

- Add more button styles: 
--button with glyphicon in it

- Add styles for text area: 
--area background becomes blue with focus
--background is glass, with interesting font inside
--rotating colors in text area background

- Add styles for text: 
--Red color
--blue color
--Yellow Matrix (intereseting font here as well);
--different font
--large text
--small text
--bold
--strikethrough
--weak
--rainbow font where each letter is a different color of the rainbow (split rainbow), make sure to give an interesting font
--gradient color text (continuous rainbow)

- Apply style to drop downs so that they don't look so plain

- Make page reactive so that if there is not room on the right side for the drop-downs, that they shift over to the top and it becomes the top area instead of the right area?
-- Basically just reactive web design???
