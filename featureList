- Change index.html to use bootstrap grids instead of 50% width divs.

- Refactor the javascript to have a smaller, better designed function. Right now there is a lot of copy/pasting that could be solved by a better function.

- Add more button styles: 
--button with glyphicon in it

- Add styles for text: 
--rainbow font where each letter is a different color of the rainbow (split rainbow), make sure to give an interesting font

- Apply style to drop downs so that they don't look so plain

- Make page reactive so that if there is not room on the right side for the drop-downs, that they shift over to the top and it becomes the top area instead of the right area?
-- Basically just reactive web design???
